# Intro

Nand2Tetris, in this course a modern computer will be built using only as a building block the nand logic circuit. 
The components to be constructed are: 
 
1. Logic circuits (nor, not, or, and, xor, mux, dmux, etc).
2. Memory, (Primary and Sencundary).
3. CPU,   (Machine Language, ALU, PC, etc).
4. Computer Architecture.
5. Assembler.
6. Virtual Machine.
7. High-Level Language.
8. Compiler.
9. Operational System.
10. Tetris Game.

# Objective

The tetris game is expected to run on the final platform.

# Book
The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles.[2]

# Course

"Nand to Tetris courses are typically offered as a 1-semester course, consisting of ~13 weekly 3-hour meetings. The course and the book are completely self-contained, requiring only programming (in any language) as a pre-requisite. All the knowledge necessary for building the computer is embedded in the supplied lectures, projects, and book chapters. The result is a synthesis course that can be taken at any stage in an undergraduate or graduate CS program following programming."

# Why Bother? 
"Because many CS students don't understand how computers work; because fewer CS programs requires a compilation course; because many computer architecture courses are too detailed; because nothing beats the thrill of creating something from almost nothing; because Nand to Tetris engages students in implementing some of the coolest algorithms, data structures and techniques in applied computer science, and because the typical student feedback in Nand to Tetris courses is "the best course I ever took."
