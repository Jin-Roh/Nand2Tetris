* Intro

  Nand2Tetris is a course that aims to build a general-purpose
  computer system from the ground up using only as building
  block the nand logic gate.

  The list of components to be constructed:

  1. Logic gates
  2. Memories
  3. Arithmetic-Logic Unit
  4. Central Processing Unit
  5. Computer Architecture
  6. Assembler
  7. Virtual Machine
  8. High-Level Language
  9. Compiler
  10. Operational System
  11. Tetris Game

* Goal

  The tetris game is expected to run under the final/top
  constructed layer (OS), achieve that way a little bit
  of knowledge about the whole technology stack of a
  modern/general-purpose compute.

  From NAND to Tetris!

* Book

  The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from
  First Principles [2]

* Course

  "Nand to Tetris courses are typically offered as a 1-semester
  course, consisting of ~13 weekly 3-hour meetings.
  The course and the book are completely self-contained,
  requiring only programming (in any language) as a pre-requisite.
  All the knowledge necessary for building the computer is embedded
  in the supplied lectures, projects, and book chapters.
  The result is a synthesis course that can be taken at any stage in
  an undergraduate or graduate CS program following programming."

* Motivation

  "Because many CS students don't understand how computers work;
  because fewer CS programs requires a compilation course;
  because many computer architecture courses are too detailed;
  because nothing beats the thrill of creating something from almost
  nothing; because Nand to Tetris engages students in implementing
  some of the coolest algorithms, data structures and techniques in
  applied computer science, and because the typical student feedback
  in Nand to Tetris courses is "the best course I ever took."

* Projects

  1. Boolean Logic
  2. Boolean Arithmetic
  3. Sequential Logic
  4. Machine Language
  5. Computer Architecture

* Dependencies

  - Nand2Tetris simulators[4].

* Future
  - Project 6: Assembler
